Welcome to the OK Lab Cologne! Our meetings takes place every two weeks. Swing by one of our next meetups! At the moment we are working on a fine dust measuring device for mobile measurements, a local district dating app to find place where to live and a children's playground information app for Cologne's schools and students.

Of course, there are also issues that cannot be realized in the short term, such as the disclosure of the public transport time-table. An app that shows the defibrillator in the vicinity of one's own environment is ready. Also, the Wasserqualit√§tsApp from Heilbronn for Cologne has been redeployed. We welcome new faces who support us or bring their own ideas.
